Chat with Ryan on async sync

Ryan
we use sync rather than async
2:47
we were using async when we started with Nightwatch, it was ok but not full proof

Mark  2:48 PM
Ok Thanks. So to check if a link is working you would click() it? Not check the response that came back (generally)

Ryan  2:48 PM
yeah , even in async we were having to do that in a lot of cases, we usually use a waitUntil() method that gives us really good stability

Mark  2:49 PM
Perfect thanks for that.

driver.waitUntil(() => {
          return driver.isKeyboardShown() === false;
        }, {
          timeout: 5000,
          timeoutMsg: 'expected keyboard to not be shown',
        });

or

2:49
driver.waitUntil(() => {
      return $(this.locators.archiveButtonText(index)).getText() !== text;
    }, {
      timeout: 5000,
      timeoutMsg: 'Message archive button not working?',
    });
2:49
its used alot

we also use other waits, WDIO stuff like
2:51
$(this.locators.archiveButtonText(index)).waitForDisplayed();

2:51
but the other wait is good as you can specifically wait for something you are
expecting to load as a result of a click, and far more stable than WDIO waits
